# Point Cloud Architectures - implementations
Implementation of SOTA Point Cloud Deep Learning Networks Using TensorFlow(TF) 2 or Pytorch

Inspired by [Machine-Learning-Tokyo/CNN-Architectures](https://github.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo/CNN-Architectures), this repo is to show how to implement SOTA point cloud deep learning-based networks with the tensorflow.keras Functional API based on the original paper. For each architecture there is:

- the paper in which the architecture was originally published where we highlighted the parts needed for the implementation
- a jupyter notebook with a step-by-step description of how to use this information to infer the structure of the model and code it
- a diagram of the model that corresponds to the architecture and the code structure
